{"domain":"home_office_deduction","narrative":"Every morning, as the sun filters through the curtains of my living room, I prepare for another day of shaping young minds. My apartment, cozy and just the right size with its three rooms, has become both my haven and my classroom. The mornings when I weave through the halls of the local school, greeting eager students, are vibrant and lively. However, those moments account for just a slice of my day.\n\nMost of my work unfurls within the confines of my home. Nestled in the corner of my living room, my makeshift desk is cluttered with textbooks and papers. I've carved out this small corner as my own, a place where lessons are crafted and assignments are meticulously graded. It isn’t grand or meticulously organized, but it serves its purpose well. The hum of the city outside mingles with the hushed rustle of paper and the quiet tap of keys on my laptop. This quaint nook is my sanctuary, a place where creativity and order must coexist.\n\nThroughout the day, as I alternate between papers and digital files, I shift from the comfort of my living corner to the din of a classroom. The harmony between these two worlds keeps me grounded, even though home draws me back each afternoon. It's a rhythm I've grown accustomed to—balancing student interaction with solitary preparation—fostered by the walls of my trusted apartment.","underlying_facts":["The narrator works as a Teacher.","The narrator lives in an apartment with 3 rooms.","The narrator uses a working corner in the living room for their professional activities.","The narrator has no other available workplace outside their apartment for professional use.","The narrator occasionally works from a school where classes are held, but primarily prepares lessons and grades assignments from home."],"rule_signals":["A working corner in a living room or bedroom is generally not considered a home office for tax deduction purposes.","If the working space at home does not qualify as a home office, the home office flat rate can be claimed up to 1,260 EUR per year (6 EUR per day)."],"reasoning_trace":"- The home office is not eligible, but the taxpayer can use the home office flatrate.

{"domain":"home_office_deduction","narrative":"Every morning, I start my day by shuffling a few steps from the living room to the home office, maneuvering my way past the piles of code snippets and tech books that occasionally find their way out of the office. This three-room apartment has been my sanctuary, and sometimes, my silo. The small third room at the end of the hallway is where I spend most of my waking hours, immersed in lines of code and virtual meetings. As a Software Engineer, the hum of the computer fan and the rhythm of keystrokes are as familiar to me as the sound of my own breathing.\n\nMy company doesn’t maintain a physical workspace for us, so my home office has evolved into the nerve center of my professional life. Over the years, it’s become a space crafted for focus—a stark contrast to the cozy clutter of the rest of the apartment. The desk awaits my presence at the crack of dawn and rarely lets me leave before dusk, with weeks easily slipping by in a haze of over 40 hours of coding and collaboration.\n\nSometimes, I wonder if the screen glow bathes my face akin to the sun I rarely get to enjoy. Yet, this is my reality—a blend of solitude and silent productivity. And despite the four walls encasing me daily, I’ve learned to appreciate this personal corner that allows my professional world to thrive. With each keystroke tapping against the silence, this home office is both a boundary and a bridge to my career.","underlying_facts":["The narrator works as a Software Engineer.","The narrator lives in an apartment with 3 rooms.","The home office is a separate room that is used almost exclusively for professional purposes.","The narrator often spends over 40 hours a week working in the home office.","The majority of the narrator's work as a Software Engineer is conducted from the home office.","The narrator often spends over 40 hours a week working in the home office.","No other workplace is available to the narrator for professional use.","The narrator's employer does not provide an office or desk space for their work."],"rule_signals":["The home office is the center of professional activity if the majority of professional activities are carried out in the home office.","The home office is the center of professional activity if the majority of professional activities are carried out in the home office.","Under German tax law, costs for a home office can be deducted if the home office is the center of the entire professional activity or if no other workplace is available for professional use.","Under German tax law, costs for a home office can be deducted if the home office is the center of the entire professional activity or if no other workplace is available for professional use."],"reasoning_trace":"- The home office is eligible and the pro-rata costs can be deducted.

{"domain":"home_office_deduction","narrative":"Living in a cozy, three-room apartment in Berlin has its charms, but I've often found myself yearning for just a little more space, particularly when it comes to my writing endeavors. Each morning, I shuffle around the living room, gently nudging my partner's slippers aside as I set up at my makeshift desk—a small corner tucked next to our beloved bookshelf and beneath the large window that lets in gloriously uninhibited morning light. It's become my primary workplace, where most of my writing comes to life.\n\nDespite the lack of a dedicated room, I've managed to create a tiny haven, albeit far from ideal. The living room bears witness to the gentle clacking of keyboard keys and the presence of stray pages filled with hurried notes. Still, this nook does what it can to foster my creativity.\n\nOccasionally, I fantasize about having a room solely devoted to my craft, a personal sanctuary lined with literary tomes and inspirational notes pinned to a corkboard, a place free of distractions. Alas, our apartment doesn't quite allow for such luxury. Instead, I make do with what I have, a retreat in miniature form, patiently awaiting the day when more room might be mine, not just in my daydreams, but in reality.\n\nBut for now, this corner remains my creative domain, imperfect and cramped though it may be—a peculiar little corner that shapes and cradles my passion for writing amidst the rhythm of everyday life.","underlying_facts":["The narrator works as a Writer.","The narrator lives in an apartment with 3 rooms.","The narrator uses a small corner in the living room as a workspace.","The narrator's workspace does not qualify as a home office under tax law.","The narrator considers the small corner in the living room as the primary workspace.","The narrator's work as a Writer is done mostly at this workspace.","The apartment does not have a separate room dedicated for professional use.","The narrator wishes to have a dedicated room for writing and professional activities but does not have the space."],"rule_signals":["A working corner in a living room or bedroom is generally not considered a home office for tax deduction purposes.","A home office has to be a separate room that is used almost exclusively for professional purposes.","If the working space at home does not qualify as a home office, the home office flat rate can be claimed up to 1,260 EUR per year (6 EUR per day)."],"reasoning_trace":"- The home office is not eligible, but the taxpayer can use the home office flatrate.

{"domain":"home_office_deduction","narrative":"As I sip my morning coffee, I gaze out the window of my modest three-room apartment. The view isn't spectacular, but the familiar sight of neat rows of bicycles and the echoes of morning traffic provide a comforting backdrop to the start of my day. The sun filters in gently, casting soft, warm shadows across the room. It's a small apartment, but it's mine, with every room imbued with a sense of purpose. \n\nAfter breakfast, I step into the room that serves more than just a functional role in my life—my home office. It’s cozy yet professional, outfitted with all the technical equipment an interpreter like me would need: a sturdy desk, dual monitors, soundproofing panels, and of course, a reliable headset. This room is almost sacred, reserved solely for the hours of interpretation that I conduct daily. Here, I connect with people from all corners of the globe, bridging languages and cultures, right from the heart of my home.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine working anywhere else. Once, I considered finding an external office space, but truthfully, there's a certain peace in knowing that this room is solely dedicated to my profession. It maintains an air of quiet solemnity, allowing me to transition seamlessly into work mode. \n\nToday, like most days, my schedule is filled with virtual meetings and calls—conversations that require my undivided attention and the reliance of others on my linguistic skills. It’s a role that demands precision and confidentiality, both of which this space fosters. \n\nAround midday, I take a break and step out into the living room, grateful for the simple luxury of a kitchen nearby, where I prepare a quick lunch. I glance toward the home office, reflecting on how this small room has become so instrumental in my daily life. It’s not just an office—it’s where I conduct the majority of my professional interactions, making it both an anchor and a bridge to the wider world.\n\nAs the afternoon light fades, I wrap up my final call, stretching my legs after a day spent translating diverse dialogues. It’s moments like this, taking a deep breath in my quiet apartment, that remind me how fortunate I am to have a career that fits so seamlessly into this space. Here, my personal and professional lives are both distinct and perfectly aligned, encapsulated within the walls of this three-room apartment I call home.","underlying_facts":["The narrator works as a Interpreter.","The narrator lives in an apartment with 3 rooms.","The narrator uses one room in the apartment exclusively as a home office for interpreting work.","The home office is a separate room that is used almost exclusively for professional purposes.","The majority of the narrator's interpreting work is conducted from the home office.","The narrator does not have access to another workplace for professional use."],"rule_signals":["A home office has to be a separate room that is used almost exclusively for professional purposes.","The home office is the center of professional activity if the majority of professional activities are carried out in the home office.","Costs for a home office can be deducted if the home office is the center of the entire professional activity or if no other workplace is available for professional use."],"reasoning_trace":"- The home office is eligible and the pro-rata costs can be deducted.

{"domain":"home_office_deduction","narrative":"Every morning, I navigate my way past the bookshelves that seem to overflow with dictionaries and language guides. They lead me to my modest workstation—a cozy corner in the living room of my two-room apartment here in Berlin. It's nothing grand, just a simple desk with my laptop, a notepad, and a mug filled with pens.\n\nBeing an interpreter, my work blurs the line between languages and often takes me to places far beyond these four walls—though these days, it’s usually via a Zoom window. My partner and I have managed to create a harmonious blend of personal and professional life within our shared spaces. That said, there's no extra room to entirely dedicate to my work, so I've claimed a nook in the living room as my very own translation command center.\n\nThis little corner has witnessed endless virtual meetings, translating curious idioms that stretch my brain, and a considerable amount of coffee consumption. I’ve found a rhythm that suits me, with intermissions of looking out the window when my thoughts bottleneck. It might not be an expansive office, but it’s this nook where my profession comes alive, contributing piece by piece to the global conversation.\n\nI appreciate the flexibility of working from home, and in a city where space is a luxury, it's both a choice and a necessity for now. The financial intricacies of claiming a home office may be less than straightforward, but for me, using the simplified deduction makes the most sense. It’s one less thing to fret over and allows me to focus on what matters most—bridging communication gaps one conversation at a time.","underlying_facts":["The narrator works as a Interpreter.","The narrator lives in an apartment with 2 rooms.","The narrator uses a working corner in the living room as a professional space.","The narrator does not have another separate room to use for professional activities.","The narrator does not have a separate room used almost exclusively for professional purposes.","The narrator conducts the majority of professional activities in a working corner of the living room.","The narrator claims the home office flat rate instead of deducting costs based on square meters."],"rule_signals":["A working corner in a living room or bedroom is generally not considered a home office for tax deduction purposes.","A working corner in a living room or bedroom is generally not considered a home office for tax deduction purposes.","If the working space at home does not qualify as a home office, the home office flat rate can be claimed up to 1,260 EUR per year (6 EUR per day)."],"reasoning_trace":"- The home office is not eligible, but the taxpayer can use the home office flatrate.
