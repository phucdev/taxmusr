This means that higher income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower income earners.\n\n2. **Ehegattensplitting (Spouse Splitting)**: Married couples in Germany can choose to be taxed together under the \"Ehegattensplitting\" system.

Under this method, the couple\u2019s total income is combined and then split in half. The tax rate is calculated on this half-income, and then the result is doubled to determine the total tax liability. This can reduce the overall tax burden for couples where there is a significant disparity between the incomes of the partners, as the higher earner's income is effectively taxed at the lower rate applied to the average of both incomes.\n\n2. **Analysis of Individual Incomes**: In this case, the husband earns \u20ac85,000, while the wife earns \u20ac30,000. The disparity between their incomes is significant. When there is such a disparity, joint assessment typically results in a lower combined tax burden.\n\n3. **Tax Progression in Germany**: Germany has a progressive tax system. This means that as income increases, the tax rate on the marginal income also increases. The husband's income of \u20ac85,000 would be taxed at a higher marginal rate than the combined average of their incomes if they file jointly.\n\n4. **Comparative Tax Burden**:\n   - **Individual Assessment**: Here, each partner is taxed separately. The husband\u2019s \u20ac85,000 would be taxed at a higher average rate than the wife\u2019s \u20ac30,000. Due to the progressive nature, the overall tax burden would generally be higher under this option.\n   - **Joint Assessment**: By averaging the incomes (\u20ac115,000 / 2 = \u20ac57,500), both incomes could effectively benefit from a lower marginal rate, resulting in a lower tax liability, particularly for the higher earner.\n\n5. **Tax Allowances and Deductions**: Since they also have three children, they benefit from additional tax allowances which can be integrated into the joint assessment to further reduce the taxable income.\n\nGiven these points, selecting joint assessment commonly benefits couples in similar financial situations, reducing the total taxable liability due to the advantages of the income splitting method and progressive tax scale. \n\nTherefore, for this couple, the most tax-efficient choice would be:", "token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 495, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 891, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}

In Markus's case, he is earning 75,000 euros annually, while his partner is earning 25,000 euros after taking parental leave. This results in a significant income disparity between the two individuals.\n\n2. **Ehegattensplitting (Spouse Splitting):** When couples in Germany file jointly, they benefit from the \"Ehegattensplitting\" or \"spouse splitting\" system. Under this system, the couple's total combined income is divided by two, and each half is taxed individually according to the German tax rates. Afterward, the tax of both halves is multiplied by two to get the total tax liability for the couple. This method often results in a lower overall tax liability when there is a significant income disparity between spouses, as it averages out the tax rate applied to the higher and lower incomes.\n\n3. **Tax Progression:** Germany uses a progressive tax system where higher income is taxed at higher rates. In Markus's situation, his income is at a higher tax bracket, while his partner's is in a lower one. By averaging the incomes through joint assessment, the couple potentially reduces the tax rate on Markus's higher income.\n\n4. **Child Benefits and Allowances:** Both joint and individual assessments allow the couple to claim child benefits and allowances, but joint filing might also simplify claiming these benefits under a unified assessment.\n\n5. **Resulting Tax Liability:** Given Markus's higher income, filing jointly is likely more beneficial. By splitting the income, they reduce the impact of the progressive tax brackets applied to Markus's earnings, potentially lowering the couple's overall effective tax rate and total tax liability.\n\nBased on the income disparity and the available benefits of the German tax system, opting for a joint assessment would typically result in a lower tax liability compared to individual assessments. This is especially effective when one spouse earns significantly more than the other.", "token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 435, "prompt_tokens": 390, "total_tokens": 825, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}

Fortunately, Germany considers couples like us, where one partner isn't involved with the church. Each of us has our taxes evaluated separately in light of our distinct religious affiliations, which means Martin's church tax is calculated only based on his income.\n\nWhat makes things a bit easier is where we both fully enjoy the benefits provided for our children. The child allowances have been a financial blessing, reducing our taxable income, meaning we can save a tad more for things like holidays or the kids' education.\n\nDespite the intricacies of our financial arrangements and the occasional stress during tax season, there's comfort in working through these challenges together.

Church tax is generally 8-9% of the income tax and is calculated only on the income of the church member.\n   - Since German tax law allows for separate evaluation of church tax even when filing jointly, opting for joint assessment will not change the church tax responsibility.
